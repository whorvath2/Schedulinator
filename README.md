This "Project" was based on a hackerrank.com test which I failed miserably, and I can't let that kind of thing go - I
 had to solve the problem.
 
 The problem statement was roughly as follows:
 
You are setting up a job fair, and organizing a series of presentations by company representatives. Each company will
 arrive at a particular time, and will have a presentation of a particular duration. The objective is to maximize the
  number of presentations that can be given on a single stage, given the arrival times and durations, which are
   supplied as arrays of integers. The program should return the maximum number of presentations that can be given. There will be no more than fifty companies represented at the fair.
   
I took the opportunity to do a deep dive into functional programming, which meant it took a while longer to solve. I
 still need to flesh out the unit tests to make sure I've got all of the possibilities covered.
